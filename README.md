# RHD-Sedov-Blast
Contains Python code written in Jupyter Notebook to compute a semi-analytical solution to the Sedov blast wave with radiation using the FLD approximation.

Available as Py file or IPYNB file. 

In its current state, the code is still quite messy. Some feature will be hard to manipulate to researchers unfamiliar with the code. 
Furthermore, several functions lack proper documentation and many of the comments that serve as documentation are written in Dutch. 
We shall solve these issues and simplify handling of the code by early February 2021. 

Should you have any questions on how to use or adapt the code, you may send an e-mail to mathijsvanrespaille@hotmail.com .
